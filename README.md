# Audio Emergency Detection System

A real-time audio classification system that detects distress sounds and sends location-based alerts via Telegram.

## 📋 Overview

This system uses machine learning to classify audio in real-time, specifically designed to detect distress signals in audio streams. It combines audio processing, neural networks, and automated alerting to create an emergency response tool.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **main.py** - Real-time audio capture and processing
2. **train_model.py** - Model training pipeline
3. **utils.py** - Feature extraction and alert utilities
4. **model/** - Trained model storage directory
5. **data/** - Training data organization

## 📦 Dependencies

```bash
pip install sounddevice numpy librosa scikit-learn tensorflow keras geocoder requests
```

```

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone or create project directory
mkdir audio-detection-system
cd audio-detection-system

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Data Collection
Create training data directories:
```bash
mkdir -p data/negative data/positive model
```

Organize your audio data:
- `data/negative/` - Normal conversation, ambient sounds, music
- `data/positive/` - Distress sounds, screams, emergency audio

### 3. Telegram Bot Configuration

#### Create Telegram Bot:
1. Message @BotFather on Telegram
2. Send `/newbot` command
3. Follow prompts to create bot
4. Copy the bot token

#### Get Chat ID:
1. Start conversation with your bot
2. Send any message
3. Visit: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
4. Find your chat ID in the response

#### Configure utils.py:
```python
BOT_TOKEN = "your_bot_token_here"
CHAT_ID = "your_chat_id_here"
```

### 4. Model Training
```bash
python train_model.py
```

### 5. Real-time Detection
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Audio Parameters
```python
DURATION = 3        # Recording duration in seconds
THRESHOLD = 0.90    # Detection confidence threshold
SAMPLE_RATE = 44100 # Audio sample rate
```

### Model Architecture
- Input: 40 MFCC features
- Hidden layers: 256, 128 neurons
- Output: 2 classes (normal/distress)
- Activation: ReLU, Softmax

### Feature Extraction
- **MFCC**: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (40 features)
- **Preprocessing**: Mean normalization across time axis
- **Window**: 3-second audio segments

## 📊 Performance Tuning

### Model Optimization
```python
# Adjust in train_model.py
epochs = 50           # Training iterations
batch_size = 8        # Batch size
validation_split = 0.2 # Test data percentage
```

### Detection Sensitivity
```python
# Adjust in main.py
THRESHOLD = 0.90     # Higher = fewer false positives
DURATION = 3         # Longer = more context, slower response
```

### Audio Quality
- Ensure quiet environment for training
- Use consistent audio formats (WAV recommended)
- Maintain similar recording conditions

## 🚨 Alert System

### Location Detection
- Uses IP-based geolocation (approximate)
- Returns latitude/longitude coordinates
- Fallback to "Unknown" if unavailable

### Telegram Integration
```python
# Alert message format
message = f"""
🚨 Distress Signal Detected!

📍 Location: {latitude}, {longitude}
🕐 Time: {timestamp}
🎯 Confidence: {confidence}%

Please take immediate action.
"""
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Audio Device Error:**
```bash
# List available audio devices
python -c "import sounddevice; print(sounddevice.query_devices())"
```

**Model Loading Error:**
- Ensure `model/scream_model.h5` exists
- Retrain model if corrupted
- Check TensorFlow/Keras versions

**Telegram Alerts Not Working:**
- Verify BOT_TOKEN and CHAT_ID
- Check internet connection
- Test bot manually first

**Poor Detection Accuracy:**
- Add more diverse training data
- Adjust THRESHOLD value
- Increase DURATION for more context
- Retrain with balanced dataset

### Debug Mode
Add debug information to main.py:
```python
print(f"Audio shape: {audio_data.shape}")
print(f"Prediction: {label}, Probability: {prob}")
print(f"Max amplitude: {np.max(np.abs(audio_data))}")
```

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Privacy and Ethics
- Audio recording raises privacy concerns
- Ensure compliance with local laws
- Consider consent requirements
- Implement data protection measures

### False Positives/Negatives
- System may trigger on loud music, shouting
- Environmental noise can affect accuracy
- Regular model retraining recommended
- Human verification still necessary

### Technical Limitations
- IP-based location is approximate
- Requires continuous internet connection
- Audio quality affects performance
- Processing delay (~3-4 seconds)

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Testing
```python
# Test feature extraction
audio_file = "test_sample.wav"
features = extract_features(audio_file)
print(f"Features shape: {features.shape}")

# Test prediction
prediction = predict_scream(audio_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
```

### System Testing
1. Test with known positive samples
2. Verify alert delivery
3. Check location accuracy
4. Monitor false positive rate

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Model Evaluation
- Accuracy: ~85-95% (depends on training data)
